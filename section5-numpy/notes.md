## Section 5 Numpy
- NumPy is a linear Algebra Library (libs) for Python, the reason it's important in datascience with python is that almost all of the libs that in the PyData Ecosystem rely on Numpy as one of the main building blocks
- Numpy is also incredibly fast, as it has bindings to C libraries
- It's highly recommended that you install Python using the Anaconda distribution to make sure all the underlying dependencies all sync up with the use of conda install

```
conda install numpy
```

## Numpy arrays
- used throughout the course
- 2 flavours: 
    - vectors: single dimensional arrays
    - matrices: 2d arrays, can only have one row and one column

## Identity Matrix
- np.eye(4) creates an identity matrix
- useful for linear algebra problems, it's a 2 dimensional square matrix (number of rows = number of columns)



# Numpy Operators
- Simple operations that are performed on all values in an array
